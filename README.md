## 游눩 Objective

It's a great opportunity to showcase my frontend skills, and to explore new frameworks and libraries such as **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com "tailwindcss homepage")** and **[Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/ "Nuxt.js homepage")**.

## Getting Started

### Repository Setup

1. Fork this repository

> 游뚿 You can fork this repository and play around with it. But please give me proper credit by linking back to this [repo](https://github.com/nicholas5538/portfolio, "nicholas5538 portfolio repo") if you're planning to use it. _Plagiarism is bad_ after all.

2. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

> 游누 `npm install -g pnpm`
> 游누 `brew install pnpm`

## Developing

Once you have [set up the repository](#repo-setup), you're ready to start developing. Starting the development environment is managed by the following command.

- With **_pnpm_**

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

The `dev` command will start the application in your local environment.

### Frequently Used Scripts

In addition to the `pnpm run dev` command, there are other scripts available in the package.json. Some of the most common you might get to use are:

- `pnpm run test` - Runs unit tests.

  > 游누 **Tip:** use `pnpm run test:watch` or `pnpm run test:cov` to explicitly specify the desired mode

- `pnpm run test-e2e` - Runs E2E tests.

  > 游누 **Tip:** use `pnpm run test-e2e:desktop` or `pnpm run test:mobile` to explicitly specify the desired viewport

- `pnpm run format` - Check prettier formatting through all the codes

  > 游누 **Tip:** use `pnpm run format:fix` to run auto prettier formatting across all the codes

- `pnpm run lint` - Runs TS linter through all the codes
